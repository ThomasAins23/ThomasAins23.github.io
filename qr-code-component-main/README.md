## Overview
This is my first project attempt for Frontend Mentor. I'm excited to get feeback from anyone who is willing to share! The challenge was to build out a QR code component given the design provided. I used Figma to closely inspect elements to narrow down how I should proceed. I think I've got this project fairly close to the intended specs but would love pointers on best practices.

## My process
I started by identifying the indvidual components of the QR code. While I initially want to wrap everything in a `<div>`, I ended up coming to the conslusion that I could simply have one `<section>` wrapping `<img>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements. After some trial and error with flexbox styling, I finally fit these elements into the container per the design. There was a bit of a learning curve trying to figure out Figma for the first time, but I think it was very helpful for this project and I'm excited to keep using it.
### Built with

- (Some) Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to trust my gut and build out the html the way that makes sense initially. I also learned that just because you kind of remember something from a tutorial doesn't mean you won't have to look it up and refresh on certain subjects.

### Continued development

Pending feedback, I will update accordingly. I also plan to work on the mobile version of the project to expand on what I've learned here.

### Useful resources

- [Figma's Dev Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk9xSDNboZw) - This helped me turn down the noise and focus in on what was important.
